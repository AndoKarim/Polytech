Welcome, 

please find with this README a .jar which contains all the .java files needed
to compile the program.

This program will show the distance done on a Moutain Bike with one turn of the pedals.
You'll find a Main.java which contain the main method with the creation of the different sprockets etc. 


I hope you'll find what you're searching.

Cordially.
